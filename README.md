# sessionLite

A web application for those who want to book and hire musicians. 

Reason for build

> When I first started out producing music, I was using some software that was not very intuitive or beginner friendly. I watched and read many tutorials on how to do certain actions in that software but always felt that I needed to have a conversation with someone and ask as many questions as I could think of. I tried fiverr before but would always run into some sort of problem with connecting as many sellers are in different time zones. With my app, you are able to decide if you want to meet this person over zoom or possibly in person so that you can work together!
